## ‚ú® Features

This application includes four key calculators, each with unique functionalities:

### 1. üìà Compound Interest Calculator
A versatile tool that not only projects the future value of your investments but can also solve for any missing variable. You can calculate:
- **Final Balance**: See how your investment will grow over time.
- **Time to Goal**: Determine how long it will take to reach a specific financial target.
- **Required Periodic Deposit**: Find out how much you need to save regularly to meet your goals.
- **Required Interest Rate**: Calculate the annual return needed to reach your target.
- **Required Initial Balance**: Determine the starting principal needed to achieve a future sum.

### 2. üí∞ DCA Strategy Optimizer
An advanced tool to find your optimal **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)** strategy. This calculator helps you balance commission costs by allowing you to set a custom **commission cap** (e.g., max 5% of capital for fees). It then determines the ideal number of trades and a price-drop percentage‚Äîbased on the asset's volatility‚Äîthat should trigger your next investment. The tool fully supports both **whole** and **fractional** share strategies, ensuring the plan is perfectly executable.

### 3. üîÑ Capital Gains Opportunity Cost
Decide if it‚Äôs worth selling an asset to reinvest elsewhere by calculating the **breakeven return** required on a new investment to make up for the taxes you'll pay on the sale of the first one.

---

### 4. ‚öñÔ∏è Options Strategy Calculator
A dual-functionality tool for options traders:
- **Market's Expected Move**: Estimate the potential price swing of a stock based on the prices of its at-the-money options.
- **Sell vs. Exercise**: Compare the financial outcomes of selling your option versus exercising it to help you maximize your profit.
