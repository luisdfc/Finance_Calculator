## ‚ú® Features

This application includes four key calculators, each with unique functionalities:

### 1. üìà Compound Interest Calculator
A versatile tool that not only projects the future value of your investments but can also solve for any missing variable. You can calculate:
- **Final Balance**: See how your investment will grow over time.
- **Time to Goal**: Determine how long it will take to reach a specific financial target.
- **Required Periodic Deposit**: Find out how much you need to save regularly to meet your goals.
- **Required Interest Rate**: Calculate the annual return needed to reach your target.
- **Required Initial Balance**: Determine the starting principal needed to achieve a future sum.

### 2. üí∞ DCA Strategy Optimizer
An advanced tool to find your optimal **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)** strategy. This calculator helps you balance commission costs by allowing you to set a custom **commission cap** (e.g., max 5% of capital for fees). It then determines the ideal number of trades and a price-drop percentage‚Äîbased on the asset's volatility‚Äîthat should trigger your next investment. The tool fully supports both **whole** and **fractional** share strategies, ensuring the plan is perfectly executable.

### 3. üîÑ Capital Gains Opportunity Cost
Decide if it‚Äôs worth selling an asset to reinvest elsewhere by calculating the **breakeven return** required on a new investment to make up for the taxes you'll pay on the sale of the first one.

### 4. ‚öñÔ∏è Options Strategy Calculator
A comprehensive, multi-functional tool designed for options traders to analyze trades from every angle:

- **Market's Expected Move**: Estimate the potential price swing of a stock based on the prices of its at-the-money (ATM) straddle.
- **Sell vs. Exercise**: Compare the financial outcomes of selling an in-the-money option versus exercising it to help maximize your profit by capturing any remaining extrinsic value.
- **Option Pricing Models**: Calculate the theoretical value of both European (Black-Scholes) and American (Binomial Tree) options. It includes a detailed breakdown of the Greeks (**Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho**) with clear explanations to help you understand the option's risk and reward profile.
- **Implied Volatility (IV) Analysis**: Reverse-engineer an option's market price to find the implied volatility, giving you insight into the market's expectation of future price swings. This section now includes a graph plotting the option's price against different IV levels.
- **IV Rank**: Contextualize the current IV by comparing it to its 52-week high and low, helping you determine if options are relatively cheap or expensive.
- **Advanced P/L Breakeven**: Determine the exact stock price movement required to break even on a trade before expiration. This calculator accounts for time decay (Theta), changes in implied volatility (Vega), and transaction costs to provide a precise target for your trade.
- **Probability Calculator**: Estimate the probability of an option expiring in-the-money (using Delta) and the likelihood of the underlying stock touching a specific price target before expiration.
