1. Capital Gains Opportunity Cost Calculator.py: calculates the minimum return a new investment must generate to be more profitable than holding onto your current investment after accounting for capital gains taxes.

To use it, you will need to provide three inputs:

Current Investment Value: The total current market value of your asset.

Original Cost Basis: The price you originally paid for the asset.

Capital Gains Tax Rate: Your applicable tax rate on the profit. You should enter this as a decimal (for example, a 19% tax rate should be entered as 0.19).

The script will then tell you the breakeven return percentage required from a new investment. 
2. DCA Strategy Optimizer.py: determines your optimal Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy. It calculates both the ideal number of trades to make and the specific price drop percentage to use as a buying trigger.

To use it, you will need to provide four pieces of information:

Total Capital: The total amount of money you plan to invest.

Current Share Price: The current market price of one share.

Commission Fee: The flat fee your broker charges for each trade.

Annualized Volatility: A measure of the stock's price swings over a year. You can usually find this on financial data websites (like Yahoo Finance) or your brokerage platform. It should be entered as a decimal (e.g., 60% volatility is entered as 0.60).

The script will then output your personalized DCA plan.
3. Options Strategy Calculator.py: calculates the market's expected move using the ATM straddle method and also demonstrates the financial difference between selling an option and exercising it.

I'll provide a script that performs two key options-related calculations.

Market's Expected Move Calculator: Based on the price of an at-the-money (ATM) straddle, this tool calculates the price swing (up or down) that the market is anticipating for a stock, which is especially useful before an earnings report.

Sell vs. Exercise Calculator: This tool shows you the profit difference between selling a call option to close your position versus exercising it to buy the shares.

To use it, you'll run the script and choose which calculation you want to perform. Then, you'll provide the required inputs like stock and option prices.
4. Compound Interest Calculator: This script is an interactive tool for planning your investments. It allows you to explore different financial scenarios based on the principle of compound interest.

Main Features:

Calculate the Final Balance: Find out how much money you will have in the future if you invest an initial amount and make regular contributions.

Calculate the Time Required: If you have a savings goal, the calculator will tell you how many years you will need to reach it.

Calculate the Required Interest: Find out what annual interest rate you need to reach your goal in a given time.

Calculate the Periodic Contribution: Determine how much money you need to contribute periodically to reach your financial goal.

After each calculation, the program will generate a graph that visualizes the growth of your investment over time, breaking down the initial capital, total contributions, and interest generated.
